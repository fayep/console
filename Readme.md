# Console
## Purpose
This was just a way for me to learn Go.  It is a quick way to open the jViewer
console on an AMIBIOS based LOM.

There are probably plenty of ways of doing this better.

## Installing
    go get github.com/fayep/console
    go install github.com/fayep/console

Make sure your $GOPATH/bin is in the PATH.

## Running
    console <ipaddress/hostname> <username> <password>
